(In this menu, you can disable brakes to move the robot when it is not electronically possible.
Every digit represents 1 axis, starting from axis 1. CAUTION! Needs 2nd person to position the robot by hand. Operator needs to set which axis to release the brakes on, then press and hold deadman switch & [MOVE] & [+X])
